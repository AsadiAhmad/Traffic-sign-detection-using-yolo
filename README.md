# Traffic-sign-detection-using-yolo  
Our project focuses on developing a traffic sign detection model using the YOLO framework. YOLO is renowned for its real-time object detection capabilities, making it an ideal choice for addressing the dynamic and time-sensitive nature of traffic environments. By training the model on an extensive dataset of annotated traffic sign images, we aim to equip it with the ability to accurately detect and classify  traffic signs commonly encountered on roads.

Within this project, we have harnessed the power of YOLO to proficiently detect a diverse set of 10 essential traffic signs.  
list of the traffic signs :

1.Stop   
2.No pedestrian crossing  
3.No parking  
4.Parking  
5.Give way  
6.One way  
7.No left turn  
8.Speed limit  
9.Bus lane  
10.Pedestrian crossing
